This is my take at a Discord bot that plays Rock Paper Scissors, and Hangman.

In the .env file you will have to edit the parts out to match your information.
The Discord token you get from the Developer Portal.
The Channel Id parts of the .env file are completely up to you. I personally
have a channel in my Discord where I test out the bots before releasing them
to the channels that everyone can see. But to get the ID for those you just
right click on the channel and in the list should be the option to copy the ID.
